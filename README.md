# Project: BFA/MFA Exhibitions Portal

## Description

The Chico State art department recently began publishing images and details for current and recent BFA culminating exhibitions on their site.  This is something that, as an art student myself, I had longed for.  My intent with this project is to provide a system that could act as a more comprehensive resource for archival, searching and reporting on the culminating exhibitions of BFA and MFA students.

Exhibitions will be a system that enables the college of art to catalog and share exhibition images and details.  Components of the system will include a web based interface, a controlling server, a relational database and file storage.

## Value Proposition
### Current experience
* Students share set of artist statement and photographs with descriptions via google drive, box, or similar file service
* Staff must connect descriptions with images when students fail to identify correctly with file name (e.g. “Mona Lisa” image named “IMG0253.jpg” )
* HTML programming knowledge required by staff to publish content on site
* Accordion is used to list exhibitions
* Current Culminating exhibition(s) are fully expanded and show images listed down mage
* Past exhibitions are collapsed and images can be viewed in carousel fashion
* Details Includ Artist name, Title of exhibition, Mentor name(s), Artist statement, Show announcement card/poster, Image(s), Image titles
* Most recent has experimental 3D image powered by Cupix
* Lacks automation for aging current exhibitions to historical
* Lacks search capabilities
* Lacks filter capabilities

### Goals for Improvement
* Enable students to upload artist statement, and images with descriptions
* Enable staff to assemble exhibition without coding html/css
* Allow staff to publish exhibitions at set time (e.g. timed to physical exhibition)
* Utilize show cards in electronic mailings
* Provide ability for viewers to search
* Provide reports for use by the college
